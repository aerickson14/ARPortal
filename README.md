# ARPortal

This code was created by following along the Udemy course [How to create a portal using ARKit](https://www.udemy.com/course/arkit-portal-learn-how-to-create-a-portal-using-arkit/learn/lecture/7897894#overview)

Such a cool trick to get the inner world to hide while the device is outside of the room, and it's all possible using ARKit and a SceneKit scene.

I would highly recommend checking out the course yourself if you want to learn how this is done.
